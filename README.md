# learning_to_code
A list of platforms that I have used to polish my coding skills. 

* [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all): I have linked their catalog of courses. Take advantage of their 7-day trial for PRO.
* [Code Club](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub): They have some fun Python projects in creating games or animations. 
* [Flatiron School](https://learn.co/): I've started their Coding Bootcamp prep, but then got bored/distraction. They offer [Coding Bootcamp Prep](https://learn.co/courses/bootcamp-prep), [Data Science Bootcamp Prep](https://learn.co/courses/data-science-bootcamp-prep), [Intro to Ruby](https://learn.co/courses/introduction-to-ruby), and [Intro to JavaScript](https://learn.co/courses/introduction-to-javascript).
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/): I have enjoyed their SQL and Problem Solving challenges. Other challenages are listed on their [Dashboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
* [Learn-Perl.org](https://www.learn-perl.org/): Learn Perl through the browser. Other languages to learn include: Python, Java, HTML, Go, C, C++, JavaScript, PHP, Shell, C#, Ruby, Scala, and SQL.
* [PyBites](https://codechalleng.es): For practicing Python 3. Not all challenges are free, but you do get certificates called "belts" depending on how many of them that you have completed. 
* [SQLZOO](https://zh.sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics): For learning and practicing SQL.
