* [Flatiron School](https://learn.co/): I've started their Coding Bootcamp prep, but then got bored/distraction. They offer [Coding Bootcamp Prep](https://learn.co/courses/bootcamp-prep), [Data Science Bootcamp Prep](https://learn.co/courses/data-science-bootcamp-prep), [Intro to Ruby](https://learn.co/courses/introduction-to-ruby), and [Intro to JavaScript](https://learn.co/courses/introduction-to-javascript).
